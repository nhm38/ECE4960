### Task B PID Stunt
I started the car XXX meters from the wall. I never got the Kalman Filter to work well so I estimated the distance to start the drift to be XXX mm ( m) through several tests. Because the car is accelerating somewhat unpredictably as it starts from rest and move towards the car, extrapolating the TOF data wasnâ€™t super accurate, so I decided not to use this approach.
